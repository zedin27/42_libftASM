# Notes from "Low-Level Programming" C, ASM, and Program Execution on Intel 64 Architecture
by Igor Zhirkov

***

Note from Adam:
> For anyone trying to learn ASM Iâ€™d suggest learning all the basics first, how stack/heap works, how program execution is tracked, registers and which are reserved and for what purpose, etc.
Then do ASM alone before diving into Inline ASM, itâ€™ll make it a lot clearer ðŸ™‚

***

The ways that I write my notes is to make a similar concept in a real situation and interpret it for myself. This is, by far, the best way I can learn from concepts that are difficult to process. This process of learning is to make an analogy and it will be related to _Tom & Jerry_ series because is my favorite cartoon with malleable information to dissect.

**Computer architecture** is the structure of how computers works in a low scope level.
This brought features of a different understanding, which are:

* Memory stores in bits only.
* Memory is stored as a bit string - which is encoded with instructions and data to operate.
* Memory is organized into cells (a.k.a registers)
* Instructions run in a sequential order - meaning from top to bottom (unless you run special jump instructions).

A little of vocabulary before we moving on:
1. **Assembly Language:** Low-level language which retains memory information in a sequential machine language
2. **CPU (central processing unit):** execute instructions.
3. **ALU (arithmetic logic unit):** where magic happens; logic gates where it does basic operations in one execution.
4. **Registers:** cells placed on the CPU. They are faster to access on the circuit, complicated, and expensive. They are based from _transistors_, while main memory uses condensers.
5. **Hardware stack:** push and pop emulation with machine instruction and register
6. **Cache:**
7. **Hit and miss:**
8. **Virtual memory:** Abstraction of physical memory; helps distribute between programs in a safer and more effective way, and isolates programs from one another.
9. **Physical memory:**
10. **Locality of reference:** (read below)
11. **Temporal locality:** accesses to one address are likely to be close in time.
12. **Spatial locality:**  accessing an address X the next memory access will likely to be close to X.


**note**: Memory state and values of registers fully describe the Cpu state (from a programmerâ€™s point of  view). understanding an instruction means understanding its effects on memory and registers.

There is a slight problem when it comes to ASM coding. **_do not try to multitask_** otherwise you will end up making multiple of bugs and there will be holes just like Tom [add inline GIF of Tom having leak problems].

CPU performance and memory are different for the system management in the long run. So, the way that engineers built the hardware in such a way, is to build a strong CPU that can process most of the memory to increase speed by choosing other types of underlying circuits.

**Okay, where is the Intel 64 you were talking about?**
Some computers are built in with Intel in it, some don't. If the computer is built with a different processor, then these notes are not good for you to follow along. The computer that I'm using has Intel, so we are good.

Typical programs are using the following pattern: the data working set is small and can be kept inside registers. After fetching the data into registers once we will work with them for quite some time, and then the results will be flushed into memory.

The general purpose registers are interchangeable and can be used in many different commands. There are 64-bit registers.

| bit register  | alias         | functionality  				|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------: 				|
| `r0`          | `rax`         | accumulator    				|
| `r1`          | `rcx`         | used for cycles				|
| `r2`          | `rdx`         | stores data    				|
| `r3`          | `rbx`         | base register 				|
| `r4`          | `rsp`         | stores address in the top     |
| `r5`          | `rbp`         | stack's base			        |
| `r6`          | `rsi`         | src str[i] manipulation cmd	|
| `r7`          | `rdi`         | dst str[i] manipulation cmd	|
| `r8`          | `idfk`        |    $1          |
| `r9`...`r15`  | N/A           | $1600          |

**note: All instructions have different sizes!**

There is a difference between CPU cache and registers. Registers allows faster access, which is encoded into opcode for ASM language.

Register -> few bytes long

Cache -> contains instruction code and store temporary copy of read or written data.

**How to run an ASM code?**
nasm -f macho64 .s -o .o
ld .o -o executable_name

**Python int/hex calculator**
python -c 'print(hex(0x20000 + syscall_number))'
